  <h3>< Frequently Asked Questions About serendipity > </h3>
  <ol>
    <li><p><strong>Are serendipity and fate related?</strong><br>
    Serendipity and fate differ in meaning in a number of important ways.
    The former is defined as "the faculty or phenomenon of finding valuable or agreeable things not sought for," and while fate likewise may be concerned with "something that happens to a person," it need not (in fact, often is not) be pleasant.
    Among the meanings of fate are "an inevitable and often adverse outcome, condition, or end," "final outcome," and " the circumstances that befall someone or something."<p></li>

    <li><p><strong>What is the difference between serendipity and luck?</strong><br>
    There is considerable similarity between luck and serendipity, but there are also settings in which one word might be more apt than the other.
    Serendipity has a fairly narrow meaning, one that is concerned with finding pleasing things that one had not been looking for, while luck has a somewhat broader range (with meanings such as "a force that brings good fortune or adversity," "success," and "the events or circumstances that operate for or against an individual").
    One might easily be said to have luck that is bad, which one would not say of serendipity.</p></li>

    <li><strong>"How is serendipity used in other parts of speech?"</strong><br>
    Serendipity is a noun, coined in the middle of the 18th century by author Horace Walpole (he took it from the Persian fairy tale The Three Princes of Serendip).
    The adjective form is serendipitous, and the adverb is serendipitously.
    A serendipitist is "one who finds valuable or agreeable things not sought for."</li>
